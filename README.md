### Predicting Patient Experience
The Python coding language is used to build predictive models, utilizing the Jupyter Notebook. Several models were built, including logistic regression, 
decision trees and random forests, to determine the model with the best accuracy score, ROC and confusion matrix. 
Some models were split into a training and testing set, while other models used cross validation and k-folds techniques to reduce overfitting and biasness. 
Multiple libraries were used including, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn statsmodels and sklearn.

### Predicting Health Insurance Cost
A KMeans clustering algorithm was constructed in Python, to understand attributes that affect insurance costs. By understanding these costs, insurance companies can help customers understand their future costs, such as low or high premiums based on attributes such as, age, bmi, smoker and number of children.

### Predicting Hospital Readmissions
An exploratory data analysis was conducted in Python to understand hospital readmissions. Many patients get readmitted to hospitals within 30 days after they're discharged, due to various reasons. Many of these readmissions can be avoided by identifying patients that are at high risk for readmissions, using input variables such as, gender, race, age, diagnosis, icu patients, patients with chronic conditions and length of stay. Variables such as these will be helpful to understand, so that additional precautions can be taken to reduce the readmission rate. Therefore, by predicting hospital readmissions, hospitals can take early action to prepare accordingly.

### Predicting Healthcare Charges
An OLS model was constructed in Python to predict charges at a hospital based on various medical procedures. Other demographics, such as age, gender and race were also considered in the model to understand the relationship between charges and these other attributes. By understanding the relationship between charges and gender, race or age, hospitals can determine if any biasness exist, which may also be a malpractice risk. Hospitals can also use this analysis to understand what influences high and low costs.
