### Predicting Patient Experience
The Python coding language is used to build predictive models, utilizing the Jupyter Notebook. Several models were built, including logistic regression, 
decision trees and random forests, to determine the model with the best accuracy score, ROC and confusion matrix. 
Some models were split into a training and testing set, while other models used cross validation and k-folds techniques to reduce overfitting and biasness. 
Multiple libraries were used including, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn statsmodels and sklearn.
